# SwiftUI: Mastering Shape Animations
If I write some text here, what will happen? How will it show up once I "commit changes?" I'm very curious to see how this text will display and, even moreso, I'm curious to know how the text wraps and what happens if I place an empty line.

I have now placed an empty line.
