# SwiftUI: Mastering Shape Animations
## Introduction
First, I would like to provide an example of the finished product and briefly explain what my "specs" were. Then I will discuss the entire process of satisfying the specs and the steps taken to accomplish this animation. As I explain the process of building this animation, I will provide enough detail and code for most readers to build and animate their own custom shapes. I will also provide a list of all resources I used to understand Shape animation in SwiftUI and build this animation myself. This should prove to be a one-stop collection of resources for anyone trying to understand and utilize SwiftUI Shape animations.
