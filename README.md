# SwiftUI: Mastering Shape Animations
## Introduction
In this article, I will explain the nuances of working with Shapes in SwiftUI. Topics covered will include building custom Shapes, working with AnimatableData to animate Shape changes, and utilizing AnimatableVector to create custom types that will assist in working with complex Shapes and difficult animations.

I will provide quite a bit of code. Much of the provided code will have originated from other authors. Their articles will be cited at the end. Some of the provided code will be mine, but based on something I saw in an article or StackOverflow post. These will also be cited.  All of the code referenced in this article is completely available for use without restriction.

First, I would like to provide an example of the finished product and briefly explain what my "specs" were. Then I will discuss the entire process of satisfying the specs and the steps taken to accomplish building this Shape and it's accompying animation. As I explain the process of creating this animation, I will provide enough detail and code for most readers to build and animate their own custom shapes. I will also provide a list of all resources I used to understand Shape animation in SwiftUI. This should prove to be a complete collection of resources for anyone trying to understand and utilize AnimatableData for Shape animations in SwiftUI.
